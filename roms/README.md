# `roms/` — what each image is, and where it came from

*[← Doc map](../doc/README.md) · [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md)*

Seventeen ROM images plus the CodeTank cartridges in [`codetank/`](codetank/).
POM1 loads them at boot or when a card is plugged; none is generated at build
time except where this file says so.

**Why this file exists.** Two of these images are reproducible from published
sources and already document themselves (`ehbasic`, `msbasic`); the rest carried
no provenance anywhere in the tree. That is the kind of gap that cannot be filled
later by anyone but the person who assembled the collection — so it is written
down here while it still can be.

**Confidence is marked.** Lines tagged **⟨to confirm⟩** are POM1's best
reconstruction from the code, the credits and public sources, not first-hand
knowledge of which dump was taken from where. Treat them as claims to check, not
as facts. Everything untagged is verifiable from this repository.

`WozMonitor.rom` is the one image POM1 also carries **compiled in**, as the
fallback for a machine that cannot find `roms/` at all. `src/Memory.cpp` records
its SHA-256 in a comment; what actually prevents the two copies drifting is
`tests/rom_fallback_smoke_test.cpp`, which asserts they are byte-identical.

## 1. Apple firmware, 1976–1977

`WozMonitor.rom`, `basic.rom`, `ACI.rom`, `charmap.rom`, `apple2e_char.rom`,
`applesoft-lite-*.rom`

These are **Apple Computer's own firmware**, written by Steve Wozniak (the
Monitor, Integer BASIC and the ACI, all 1976) or derived from Apple's Apple II
line (the character generators, Applesoft). Apple has never placed them under a
free licence, and POM1 does not claim one: they are included because an Apple-1
emulator without the Woz Monitor does not boot at all, and because the Apple-1
replica and emulation community has distributed these 256- and 4096-byte images
openly for decades. If Apple ever objects, the answer is to remove them — the
emulator has a built-in Monitor fallback and every other image is optional.

**`apple2e_char.rom`** is the Apple IIe Enhanced US 4 KB character ROM,
also used by POM2. It is the fallback for GEN2 when `gen2_char.rom` is absent
or invalid; its glyph artwork differs from Uncle Bernie's card.

⟨to confirm⟩ Where each of these six images was originally obtained — which
archive, which dump, which date. The bytes are stable and hashed above; only the
sourcing is unrecorded.

## 2. Community firmware, named authors

| Image | Author | Origin | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `krusader-1.3.rom` | **Ken Wessen** | Krusader 1.3 (65C02), released 2007-12-24 for the Replica 1. Source: <https://github.com/st3fan/krusader> | ⟨to confirm⟩ **not stated upstream** — the published source carries no licence file |
| `cffa1.rom` | **Rich Dreher** | CFFA1 CompactFlash interface firmware. Added to POM1 2026-04-11. | ⟨to confirm⟩ |
| `sdcard.rom` | **Antonino "Nippur72" Porcino** | P-LAB SD CARD OS 1.3. The *source* is vendored and fully documented in [`../doc/sdcardos_nippur72_1.3/POM1_PROVENANCE.md`](../doc/sdcardos_nippur72_1.3/POM1_PROVENANCE.md) (repo, commit `8adb29c`, fetched 2026-07-05) | **CC BY 4.0**, per the P-LAB project pages |
| `jukebox.rom` | **P-LAB** (Claudio Parmigiani & Jacopo Rosselli) | Assembled from P-LAB's EPROM_CREATOR stripped files by [`../doc/JUKEBOX_ROM_CREATOR/build_jukebox_rom.py`](../doc/JUKEBOX_ROM_CREATOR/build_jukebox_rom.py), which is in-tree | ⟨to confirm⟩ presumably the P-LAB terms (CC BY 4.0) that cover the other P-LAB cards |
| `XACI.rom` | **Uncle Bernie** | The Extended ACI's second PROM page, published on Applefritter (août 2026). Behaviour documented in `CLAUDE.md` and pinned by `extended_aci_smoke`. | ⟨to confirm⟩ |

Krusader, the CFFA1 and the GEN2 card are all credited by name in
[`../README.md`](../README.md); this table records what those credits mean for
each *file*.

## 3. Reproducible from published sources

**`gen2_char.rom` — character artwork by Uncle Bernie.** Generated from
[`gen2_char.template`](gen2_char.template), his unmodified `a1_G2_chargen`
template supplied to Arnaud in the Applefritter message of 21 September 2026.
Bernie explicitly instructed using the first eight of each glyph's nine rows
and ignoring the ninth, giving the improved set with its blank scanline on top.
Regenerate with:

```sh
python3 tools/build_gen2_chargen.py roms/gen2_char.template roms/gen2_char.rom
```

This is POM1's rendering format, not a hardware EPROM burn image: 256 cells
of eight bytes, bit 0 at the left, 1 = lit. The eight template columns are
preserved; the renderer displays the first seven dots of each cell. Redundant
normal bands are filled from `$40-$7F`; flashing selects `$00-$3F` for the
inverse phase. `$E0-$FF` retains the exact lowercase, punctuation and checkerboard
cursor artwork and never flashes. The template was supplied for this integration;
no separate general redistribution licence was stated in the message.

These are **built, not found** — the tree carries the source and the build
script, so a successor can regenerate them and verify the bytes.

| Image | Build | Licence position |
|---|---|---|
| `ehbasic.rom` | [`../dev/ehbasic/`](../dev/ehbasic/) — `build_ehbasic.sh`. The Apple-1 port is POM1's own; upstream shipped no such port. | Documented in [`../dev/ehbasic/README.md`](../dev/ehbasic/README.md). Lee Davison's terms are quoted there in full, and the string `DERIVED FROM EHBASIC` in the image is a **licence condition**, not decoration — `ehbasic_smoke` asserts it is still present. |
| `msbasic.rom` | [`../dev/msbasic/`](../dev/msbasic/) — `build_msbasic.sh`, from pinned commits of `mist64/msbasic` and a `coopzone-dc` overlay; the script asserts the resulting hash. | Documented in [`../dev/msbasic/README.md`](../dev/msbasic/README.md), including the fact that **neither upstream repository carries a licence file**. |
| `codetank/*.rom` | [`../tools/build_codetank_rom.py`](../tools/build_codetank_rom.py), from sources under `../dev/codetank/` and `../sketchs/`. `tools/verify_codetank_roms.py` is the burn gate. | POM1's own, plus the per-program credits in `../dev/codetank/README.md`. |

`applesoft-gen2.rom` and `logo-gen2.rom` are **DevBench sketches**, which is why
they are not in `dev/`: each is an ordinary asm project under `sketchs/gen2/`
with a `.sketch.json` telling the Bench how to build it.

| Image | Sketch | Links at | Entry |
|---|---|---|---|
| `applesoft-gen2.rom` | [`../sketchs/gen2/applesoft_gen2/`](../sketchs/gen2/applesoft_gen2/) — `applesoft-gen2.s` + `io.s`, cfg `applesoft_gen2.cfg` (`gen2gfx.inc`, `macros.s`, `zeropage.s` are `.include`d) | `BASROM $9800`, size `$2800` | `9800R` |
| `logo-gen2.rom` | [`../sketchs/gen2/tool_logo_gen2/`](../sketchs/gen2/tool_logo_gen2/) — `logo_gen2.asm`, cfg `logo_gen2.cfg`, defines `CODETANK_BUILD` + `LOGO_GEN2`, plus seven library modules from `dev/lib/` named in its `.sketch.json` | `CODE $6000`, size `$5000` | `6000R` |

Both build on POM1 preset 2 (GEN2 HGR Development Bench): open the sketch in the
Bench and Build. Their behaviour is pinned by `applesoft_gen2_smoke` and by
`bench_logo_inject_smoke` respectively, so a rebuild that shifts an entry point
fails the suite rather than shipping quietly.

**Installing a rebuilt image into `roms/` is manual** — no script copies it, and
the shipped `.rom` files are prebuilt artefacts of exactly this path.

## What still needs the maintainer

Everything tagged **⟨to confirm⟩** above, which is:

1. The sourcing of the six Apple images (§1) — which archive or dump, and when.
2. The licence position of Krusader, the CFFA1 firmware, the Juke-Box image and
   the Extended ACI page (§2).
Nothing here blocks running or building POM1. It matters the day someone else
has to answer for the collection.
