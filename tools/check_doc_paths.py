"""Fail when the documentation cites a source file that does not exist.

POM1 carries 26 000 lines of markdown against 81 000 lines of C++ — an unusually
good ratio, and an unusually large surface for silent drift. A file gets renamed
or split, a dozen documents keep naming the old path, and nothing notices until
somebody reads a paragraph and goes looking. The git history already contains a
manual "20 dérives corrigées" pass; that is the work this script exists to stop
repeating.

It is the third guard of its kind, after tools/check_version_sync.sh
(version_sync) and tools/check_imgui_pin.sh (imgui_pin_sync): pick one fact the
docs must agree with the tree about, and let ctest hold it.

WHAT COUNTS AS A CITATION
    A backtick span that looks like a source path — it carries a directory
    separator and a known code/config extension. `Memory.cpp` on its own is a
    bare basename and is deliberately NOT checked: CLAUDE.md says such names are
    to be found under src/, and enforcing that would flag every prose mention.

HOW A CITATION IS RESOLVED  (any one hit is enough)
    1. straight from the repo root                     src/Memory.cpp
    2. relative to the citing document's directory     ../cc65/apple1.cfg
    3. under src/, the documented convention           bench/CodeBench.cpp
    4. under dev/, as the dev/lib READMEs write it     lib/m6502/math.asm
    5. under dev/lib/, the library-relative form       m6502/math.asm

Placeholders (NN, <name>, globs) are skipped — they name a shape, not a file.
So are paths rooted in another project or toolkit (see EXTERNAL_ROOTS), and
CHANGELOG.md as a whole: a changelog is a record of what the tree WAS, and
naming a file that has since been renamed is what it is supposed to do.
