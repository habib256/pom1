; t16_a1io_rtc.s — micro-test: a1io/a1io.asm broadcast-poll reader
; ============================================================================
; GUARDS: `a1io_read_reg` is the single primitive the whole A1-IO/RTC register
;   set hangs off. It does not address a register — it SPINS on the card's
;   broadcast cycle until the index it wants appears on PORTA, then latches
;   PORTB. Two things can silently break and neither shows on screen:
;
;     * the strobe/index decode — `LDA VIA_IRA / BPL / AND #$1F / CMP` reads
;       bit 7 as "a new register is on the bus" and the low five bits as its
;       index. An off-by-one in the mask, or a card that stops setting the
;       strobe, turns every read into an infinite spin or into the WRONG
;       register's value, which still looks like a plausible clock.
;     * the value latch — PORTB must be read AFTER the index matched, not
;       before; reading it a cycle early returns the previous register.
;
;   Reading six registers whose values are known EXACTLY is what separates
;   those failures from a working read. `--rtc-freeze` is what makes them
;   known: a clock that ticks cannot be asserted, and this driver would
;   otherwise be re-run against a different second every time.
;
;   Frozen instant: 2026-09-02 14:37:51.
;     hours 14 = $0E   minutes 37 = $25   seconds 51 = $33
;     day    2 = $02   month    9 = $09   year (−2000) 26 = $1A
;   The registers are BINARY, not BCD — a card that started emitting BCD
;   would land $14/$37/$51 here and every byte would move.
;
;   Reads run twice, from two different starting indices, so a reader that
;   happened to work only when the broadcast cycle is at phase 0 fails: the
;   second pass starts mid-cycle, on YEAR, and must return the same six bytes.
