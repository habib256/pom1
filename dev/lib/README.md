# dev/lib — POM1 6502 software libraries

*[← dev/ index](../README.md)*  ·  build layer: [`../cc65/`](../cc65/README.md)  ·  projects: [`../codetank/`](../codetank/README.md)

*Tutorial: [6502 developer guides index](../../sketchs/doc/README.md) — step-by-step programming guides for every track in this tree.*

Reusable 6502 code shared by the Apple-1 programs POM1 ships (`sketchs/<profile>/`
DevBench sketches and `sketchs/<card>/` multi-file builds). The compiled
artefacts land under `software/<dir>/` — that's what POM1 loads; release bundles
omit `dev/`.

The tree is organised on **two crossed axes**: by **target** (one subdirectory
per card / peripheral) and by **language track** (assembly `.include`-style libs
and cc65 **C** runtimes for the same card). A program picks ONE card and ONE
language and links only that.

## The two video backends are one interface, not two copies

Before anyone sets out to factor the apparent duplication between `gen2/` and
`tms9918/`: **it is not duplication, and the factoring already happened.**

`bubble.asm` / `gen2_bubble.asm` and `text_bitmap.asm` / `gen2_text_bitmap.asm`
carry the same public symbols on purpose, and `gen2_logom2.asm` implements the
whole TMS9918 Mode-2 API — `init_vdp_g2`, `vdp_set_write`, `line_xy`,
`clear_bitmap`, `plot_set` — on GEN2 HGR. The backend is chosen by **ld65**, for
the same reason [`gfx/`](gfx/README.md) resolves its per-pixel store at link
time: Parmigiani's one-board rule means a binary ever talks to one video card,
so there is nothing to arbitrate at runtime and no indirection to pay.

What that buys is visible in one place. LOGO is **5 426 lines** under
[`../../sketchs/tms9918/tool_logo/`](../../sketchs/tms9918/tool_logo/); its GEN2
edition, [`../../sketchs/gen2/tool_logo_gen2/`](../../sketchs/gen2/tool_logo_gen2/),
is **thirty-one lines** that define `LOGO_GEN2` and `.include` the other. One
program, two cards.

Two things follow, and both matter to anyone editing these files:

- **The interface is TMS-SHAPED, not merely TMS-named — and that is why it is
  not renamed.** `gfx/` invents neutral names; this side speaks the TMS9918's
  VDP vocabulary (`init_vdp_g2`, `vdp_set_write`, `tms9918_pad18`). The
  temptation is to call that a debt and neutralise it. Measure first: of the
  routine symbols the two backends share, **five are a bare `rts` on GEN2** —
  `disable_sprites`, `vdp_set_write`, `vdp_set_read`, `vdp_display_off`,
  `tms9918_pad18`. They are not video operations with two implementations, they
  are TMS *hardware ceremony*: `vdp_set_write` programs the chip's
  auto-increment address latch, and `tms9918_pad18` is an 18-cycle VRAM pacing
  cushion. HGR has neither. A neutral name — `video_set_write` — would promise
  that every backend does something, which is false; **the chip's own name tells
  the truth, and a neutral one would not.** What a third video card would
  actually cost is not a rename but a decision about those five, and that is
  worth knowing before the day it arrives.
- **The DRAWING half is not card-neutral either, and that is the real argument
  against an assembly `gfx`.** It is tempting to say the interface splits into
  "drawing, shareable" and "chip ceremony, per-card". It does not. **The screen
  width sets the ARITHMETIC width.** HGR is 280 px, so a full-width line's `dx`
  overflows a byte and Bresenham has to run 16-bit; the TMS's 256 fit in eight
  bits. Measured on the same algorithm by the same author:

  | | dx | source |
  |---|---|---|
  | `tms9918m2.asm` `line_xy` | 8-bit | 111 lines |
  | `gen2_logom2.asm` `line_xy16` | 16-bit | 129 lines (+16 %) |

  And GEN2 has no cheap path to fall back on: its `line_xy` is three
  instructions (`LDA #0` / `STA ln_x0h` / `STA ln_x1h`) that drop straight into
  `line_xy16`. The two backends are not one routine with a wrapper — they are
  two implementations, each using the width its own card needs. A neutral
  assembly layer would have to pick one, and picking the wider one makes the TMS
  pay 16-bit arithmetic for a 256-pixel screen.

  **`gfx/` does not disprove this — it pays that price silently.** Look at the
  signature: `void gfx_plot(unsigned x, unsigned char y)`. The asymmetry is the
  fossil of exactly this problem — Y stayed 8-bit because 192 fits, X was
  widened because 280 does not — and the TMS backend carries a 16-bit X for a
  screen that never needs one. That is affordable inside a C runtime, which is
  already paying cc65's overhead. It is not affordable in hand-written 6502,
  which is the whole reason the asm track exists.

- **The two kinds of divergence get two treatments, and the counts say why.**
  The 280-px width difference is declared in the shared source (20 `.ifdef
  LOGO_GEN2` blocks); the VDP ceremony is hidden behind the stubs above. The
  same phenomenon, handled two ways — which looks inconsistent until you count
  the call sites: **18 of the 24 ceremony calls are `tms9918_pad18` alone**,
  spread through the interpreter wherever it touches VRAM. Eighteen `.ifndef`
  blocks in the most delicate part of a 5 426-line file is worse than one `rts`.
  The stub earns its place; the other four routines (six sites between them)
  could go either way and are not worth churning.
- **What genuinely cannot be shared is the 9-bit-X seam.** HGR is 280 px wide,
  so a full-width run needs `line_xy16` / `plot_set_x16`; the TMS's 256 fits in
  a byte. That is the only `.ifdef LOGO_GEN2` in the shared source, and each
  diverging routine says so in its own header.

ctest **`asm_backends_sync`** (`tools/check_asm_backends.py`) holds the contract
without building anything: every backend symbol the shared source imports must
be exported by BOTH sides. Nothing else did — a routine added to one backend and
forgotten in the other fails as an `ld65: Unresolved external` in a build most
people never run.

## The two integration models

The single most important thing to know before consuming anything here: a file
reaches your program in one of **two** ways, and they are not interchangeable.
The split exists because ROM space is tight and `ld65` only dead-strips at object
granularity — so code you want trimmed-when-unused must be a separate object,
while tiny helpers and pure data are cheaper pasted inline.

### Model A — textual `.include` (no separate compilation)

The file is `.include`d into your program's **single** translation unit, as if
pasted at that point. `ld65` strips nothing here, so the routine libs strip
themselves: each routine is **assembled on demand** — emitted only if your
program called it before the include (see [below](#assembled-on-demand-include-after-the-callers)).
This fits small routines, equates and data.

- **All `.inc` files** — pure equates / macros / data tables, always textual:
  every card's `<card>.inc` (`apple1.inc`, `gen2.inc`, `tms9918.inc`, `sid.inc`,
  …), `apple1/zp.inc`, font tables, Sokoban level packs, sprite data.
- **Small routine libs** — `apple1/` (`print.asm`, `kbd.asm`, `delay.asm`,
  `print_num.asm`), `text40/`, the peripheral drivers (`sid/`, `sd/`, `wifi/`,
  `a1io/`, `gt6144/`), `m6502/multiply.asm` / `prng8.asm` / `prng16.asm`,
  `gen2/` init+sync+plot helpers.
- **Zero-page**: these share the canonical slot pool declared by
  [`apple1/zp.inc`](apple1/zp.inc) — `.include "zp.inc"` once, before any other
  ZP `.res`. ⚠ It is a **positional contract** ($00-$07 in fixed order); see the
  DANGER banner in that file. Pinned by `apple1/test/`.

### Assembled on demand: include after the callers

Every routine of a Model A routine lib is wrapped in

    .if .referenced(name) .and (.not .defined(name))
    name:   ...
    .endif

so a program pays only for the routines it calls: before this, HGR_Sokoban and
HGR_BBFontShow carried `umul8` + `umul4` (50 bytes) and called neither, the three
Rogue builds carried `umul8`, which nothing in the tree calls, and every GEN2 asm
sketch carried all four `gen2_init.asm` entries (~144 bytes) for the one it used.

**The rule: `.include` the library AFTER its last caller** — in practice at the
end of the program, next to the data. `.referenced` is evaluated where the
`.if` stands and ca65 does not look ahead, so only references made *before* the
include count. Between libraries the same holds: the calling library comes
first — `menu.asm` before `kbd.asm`, `dungeon.asm` before `prng16.asm`,
`shadowcast.asm` before `multiply.asm`, `at.asm` before `acia.asm`.

**Too early fails loudly, never silently.** The routine is not emitted, and the
call that comes after the include names a symbol nothing defines:

    ../../../dev/lib/games/rogue/shadowcast.asm(173): Error: Symbol 'umul4' is undefined
    make: *** [HGR_Rogue.o] Error 1

(HGR_Rogue with `multiply.asm` moved above `shadowcast.asm`, its caller.)

That is ca65 on a single translation unit; a separate object that `.import`s
the routine gets `ld65: Unresolved external` instead. What counts as a reference: any
expression naming the symbol — `JSR`, `JMP`, `.addr` jump tables, `#<(name-1)`,
`.export name`, `.assert`. Two cases to know:

- A reference written inside a `.proc` / `.scope` does not count for the global
  symbol until the scope closes — it still fails loudly (undefined symbol);
  write `::name` to reference the global one directly.
- **Code that falls through into a library routine, or reaches it without
  naming it, is the one way to get it wrong silently.** Pin it right before the
  include with `.assert name = *, error, "..."`: an `.assert` is a reference
  (the routine is emitted) and checks at link time that it really is the next
  byte (`sketchs/tms9918/tool_logo/TMS_Logo_16k.asm` does it for
  `print_str_ax`). The libraries' own fall-throughs are handled inside them:
  `wait_key` → `kbd_take`, `clear_hgr` → `hgr_fill_page`, `at_send_cmd` →
  `at_send_cr`, `gen2_hgr_init_clear`'s tail JMP — the tail is emitted with
  either entry, and an entry emitted by a later include than its tail ends on a
  `JMP` instead of falling through.

**Include guards, and the two-include pattern.** The `.not .defined(name)` half
makes every guarded file safe to include any number of times: each routine is
emitted at the first include that follows a reference, and never twice. What a
file declares rather than emits — ZP slots (each `.ifndef`-guarded), equates,
macros, `HGR_*` switches — sits under a `_NAME_LOADED_` guard or its own
`.ifndef`, and comes with the first include. That is the pattern when a library
also provides something needed EARLY (a ZP label referenced before its
definition assembles as absolute, and a macro must exist before its use):

    .include "shadowcast.asm"    ; top: its zero page
    .include "multiply.asm"
    ...  code that calls shadowcast_octants ...
    .include "shadowcast.asm"    ; end: the routines it now needs
    .include "multiply.asm"      ;      (umul4, called by shadowcast)

(`dev/lib/test/micro/t08_shadowcast.s`; `gen2/hgr_text8.asm` and
`gen2/hgr_plot_hist.asm` use it the same way.) A module whose header does not
mention "Assembled on demand" emits everything it contains, as before.

Guarded today: `apple1/` (`print`, `kbd`, `delay`, `print_num`), `m6502/`
(`multiply`, `prng8`, `prng16`), `text40/` (`menu`, `repeat`), `games/rogue/`
(`dungeon`, `shadowcast`), `gen2/` (`gen2_init`, `hgr_clear`, `hgr_plot`,
`hgr_text8`'s `hgr_puts8` / `hgr_puts8_at`, `subbyte_fill`, `hgr_pages`,
`hgr_plot_hist`), `tms9918/tms9918_xfer`, and the peripheral drivers `sd/sd`,
`a1io/a1io`, `gt6144/gt6144`, `wifi/acia` + `at`, `sid/sid_init` + `sid_play`.
`gen2_init.asm` keeps an explicit selection for the gen2c archive members
(`GEN2_INIT_SELECT`, see its header). Pinned by the micro-tests
`t50`/`t51` (`kbd.asm`, both late-entry paths; `multiply.asm` emits nothing or
`umul4` alone) and `t52` (`hgr_clear` + `gen2_init` across two includes).

**Model B objects do not benefit** — `ld65` links an object whole, so an
`.ifref` inside a separately assembled `.asm` sees only that file's own
references. What trims them is splitting into per-routine objects or archive
members, as the C runtimes and `gen2c` already do.

### Model B — separately-compiled object (`.o`) linked by `ld65`

The file is assembled / compiled on its own to a `.o` and put on the linker line
(asm via `EXTRA_ASM`, C via the `.mk` source sets). It carries `.export` /
`.import` symbols and lands in a linker-config segment; `ld65` **dead-strips**
whichever objects your program never references. Cross-TU zero-page is shared via
`.importzp` (and `zp.inc` emits the matching `.exportzp`).

- **Heavy asm objects** — `m6502/math.asm`, `tms9918/tms9918m1.asm` /
  `tms9918m2.asm`, `games/chess/chess_engine.asm`, the `gen2c/gen2_*_asm.s` kernel members.
- **Every cc65 C runtime** — [`apple1c/`](apple1c/), [`gen2c/`](gen2c/),
  [`tms9918c/`](tms9918c/). Each ships a `.mk` fragment that splits the runtime
  into **per-family** objects (e.g. `gen2_text.o`, `gen2_sprites.o`) so a program
  links only the families it calls — that per-`.o` granularity is the whole point.
- **`gfx/` as cc65 archives** — the card-neutral geometry/number layer builds to
  `gfx-gen2.lib` / `gfx-tms.lib` (`ar65`). An archive contributes **zero** bytes
  for symbols a program doesn't reference, so it is purely additive on a link
  line. The backend (per-pixel store) is resolved at **link time** to the one
  card the program links — no runtime dispatch (Parmigiani's "one board at a
  time"; see [`gfx/README.md`](gfx/README.md)).

### Which one does a given file want?

| Signal | Model |
|---|---|
| It's a `.inc` | A — textual include (equates/data/macros) |
| `.asm`/`.s`, no `.export`, routines only | A — `.include` it |
| `.asm`/`.s` with `.export` / `.import` + a CODE segment | B — assemble to `.o`, link it (`EXTRA_ASM`) |
| `.c` / cc65 runtime (has a `.mk`) | B — compile via the `.mk` source set |
| `gfx_*.c` | B — link the matching `gfx-<card>.lib` archive |

When in doubt, **the lib's own README says** (e.g. `apple1` "Drop each `.asm` in
via `.include`"; `tms9918` "links the matching `.o`"). Per-card programming
tutorials ship with POM1's user documentation.

## Why two tracks per card (a decision, not debt)

**Status: accepted.** Applies to the asm↔C pairs — [`gen2`](gen2/)/[`gen2c`](gen2c/),
[`tms9918`](tms9918/)/[`tms9918c`](tms9918c/), [`apple1`](apple1/)/[`apple1c`](apple1c/).

**Context.** Each card carries two hand-written drivers, an assembly track and a
cc65 C track; roughly half of `dev/lib` is "the same card, twice." The reflex is
to call that debt and collapse it to one runtime + backends (the `gfx/` model) or
generate one track from the other.

**Decision.** Keep both, on purpose. They are two *products*, not a primary and a
stale copy:

- The **asm track** expresses the bare metal — smallest ROM, cycle-exact hot
  paths, beam-racing (`gen2c/gen2_*_asm.s`, `gen2_sync.asm`), and pairs with the
  Apple-1-as-teaching-machine assembly tutorials in POM1's user documentation.
- The **C track** (cc65) lowers the barrier: a beginner writes a GEN2 / TMS9918
  game without learning 6502, backed by the matching cc65 tutorials in that same
  user documentation.

Neither derives mechanically from the other — cc65 output is not the idiomatic
teaching asm, and hand-tuned beam-race asm does not lower to portable C.
"Deduplicate by generation" is a non-starter; the duplication is the price of
serving two audiences.

**What is NOT duplicated** (the boundary is drawn, not blurred):

- Hardware **equates** — one canonical source (the asm `.inc`), the C side
  mirrors it, `tools/check_lib_equates.py` fails CI on drift.
- The **font** — one master glyph file, per-format tables generated
  (`tools/build_shared_font.py`).
- Card-neutral **geometry + numbers** — written once in [`gfx/`](gfx/), both
  cards link it.

So what stays written twice is only the per-card *driver logic* whose idiom is
genuinely track-specific. The shared *data and contracts* are factored or pinned.

**Consequences (accepted).**

- The two tracks agree on the **hardware contract** (guarded), not on
  **implementation**. Behavioural parity is *not* a goal: the asm track may
  exploit cycle tricks the C track won't; the C track may be simpler and slower.
  That divergence is allowed by design.
- A change to a card's hardware contract (an address, an opcode, the font) must
  edit the canonical source; the drift check tells you which mirror to follow.
- A change to *behaviour* (a bug fix in one track) does **not** auto-propagate to
  the other, and is not expected to — port it by hand if it is conceptually
  shared. Nothing enforces this because nothing can.

This record exists so the duplication reads as a chosen tradeoff, reviewable on
its merits, rather than as rot someone forgot to clean up. If that calculus ever
changes (a third card would triple the cost, say), revisit it here.

## At the C level: three pieces, not one runtime (a decision, not debt)

**Status: accepted.** Applies to the C track — [`gen2c`](gen2c/),
[`tms9918c`](tms9918c/), [`gfx`](gfx/).

**Context.** The alternative considered was to make `gen2c` / `tms9918c` *backends*
of one shared C runtime and push the [`gfx/`](gfx/) link-time-backend model up into
init and mode management, so a card-neutral runtime drives both cards.

**Decision.** Keep the three pieces distinct, by design:

- **`gen2c`** — the rich GEN2 runtime (HIRES + NTSC artifact colour, LORES
  16-colour blocks, double-buffer pages).
- **`tms9918c`** — the rich TMS9918 runtime (cell mode, bitmap mode, hardware
  sprites, per-cell colour).
- **`gfx`** — the card-neutral, **additive** layer (geometry, numbers, the
  `gfx_text` cursor façade), bound to one card at link time.

Do **not** merge the two rich runtimes into backends, and do **not** grow `gfx`
past its neutral boundary into init / mode / colour / sprites.

**Why.** Geometry, numbers and monospaced text are *genuinely* card-neutral —
that is exactly `gfx`'s scope, and why it works. Init, the mode model, the
double-buffer story, colour (GEN2 NTSC-artifact + LORES vs TMS per-cell) and
sprites (TMS hardware, GEN2 has none) are where the two cards are *most*
different. A shared interface there is either the lowest common denominator
(throws away each card's reason to exist) or a fat union of per-card no-ops
(worse than honest separation). `gfx` already says this of itself: *additive and
deliberately neutral — it does not level down the rich per-card APIs.*

**Already true today (the proof, not the promise).**
[`sketchs/portable/hello_gfx_text/`](../../sketchs/portable/hello_gfx_text/)
compiles **one** drawing source for **both** cards: every draw call is neutral
(`gfx_gotoxy` / `gfx_text` / `gfx_putu` / `gfx_putx`), and only the one-time card
bring-up is `#ifdef`'d (`gen2_hgr_init()` vs `tms_init_regs(SCREEN2_TABLE)` +
`screen2_init_bitmap()`). That residual `#ifdef` is the *honest* expression of
where the cards genuinely differ, not debt to factor away — and bring-up is
exactly the wrong thing to neutralise: **GEN2 is double-buffered**
(`gen2_set_draw_page` / `gen2_show_page`) while **TMS9918 is single-buffered,
draw-straight-to-VRAM** (no page flip at all). A neutral `vid_present()` would be
a real flip on one card and a silent no-op on the other — the fat-union trap, in
one function.

**The boundary (explicit).** Neutral = `gfx` (geometry + numbers + `gfx_text`).
Per-card = init, mode, double-buffer, colour, sprites — kept in `gen2c` /
`tms9918c`. A portable **mono** program links `gfx` + the one card's init it
needs; a program that wants colour or sprites calls that card's runtime directly.
If a future card lands that shares GEN2's *or* TMS's model closely enough to make
a neutral init/present pay off, revisit it here — until then the neutral layer
stops at `gfx`'s current edge.

## Consuming a library (build integration)

How a lib reaches your program, mechanically — the integration *model* (A vs B)
is decided above; this is the build wiring. Project Makefiles set these and
`include ../../cc65/Makefile.common` (linker configs + that fragment are
documented in [`../cc65/`](../cc65/README.md)).

- **`.include`-style asm (Model A).** Add the lib's directory to `LIB` as a
  `ca65 -I` flag and `.include "<file>"` in your source. `ca65` searches every
  `-I` path, so `.include "apple1.inc"` / `.include "print.asm"` resolves once
  the dir is on the line:

      LIB := -I ../../lib/apple1 -I ../../lib/m6502 -I ../../lib/gen2

  Then in the `.asm`: `.include "apple1.inc"` / `.include "zp.inc"` /
  `.include "print.asm"` … Put the routine libs' `.include` after your last
  call: they assemble only what was referenced before them (see
  [Assembled on demand](#assembled-on-demand-include-after-the-callers)).

- **Separately-compiled asm objects (Model B).** Heavy `.asm` carrying
  `.export`/`.import` (e.g. `tms9918m1.asm`, `math.asm`) go in
  `EXTRA_ASM`. `Makefile.common` assembles each to its own `.o` with the same
  `$(LIB)` includes and puts it on the `ld65` line, so `ld65` dead-strips it if
  unreferenced:

      EXTRA_ASM := ../../lib/tms9918/tms9918m1.asm

  Cross-TU zero-page is shared by `.importzp` in the lib and `.exportzp` in your
  TU — `zp.inc` emits the matching exports for the baseline slots; heavy libs
  that need more (`math.asm`, `tms9918m2.asm`) list them in their own README.

- **cc65 C track (Model B).** The C runtimes ship a `.mk` fragment
  (`apple1c.mk`, `gen2c.mk`, `tms9918c.mk`) exposing **per-family** source sets.
  Set the dir variables, `include` the fragment, and put only the families you
  call into `SRCS`; `ld65` strips whole families you omit. Link the card-neutral
  `gfx` layer as its prebuilt archive (`gfx-<card>.lib`). Sketch:

      GEN2C := ../../lib/gen2c
      APPLE1C := ../../lib/apple1c
      include $(APPLE1C)/apple1c.mk
      include $(GEN2C)/gen2c.mk
      SRCS := main.c $(GEN2C_CORE_SRCS) $(GEN2C_TEXT_SRCS) $(APPLE1C_SRCS)
      INCS := $(GEN2C_INCS) $(APPLE1C_INCS) -I ../../lib/gfx
      cl65 -t none -Oirs -C $(GEN2CFG) $(INCS) $(SRCS) ../../lib/gfx/gfx-gen2.lib -o main.bin

  Build the `gfx-<card>.lib` archive once with `make -C ../../lib/gfx <card>`.

## Porting between cards (TMS9918 ↔ GEN2)

The two graphics tracks look symmetric (init / clear / plot / line / text on
both sides) but the hardware contracts do NOT port 1:1. Five asymmetries that
bite, verified against the current lib sources:

| Contract | TMS9918 | GEN2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Display gating** | R1 bit 6 is a real enable. Contract: **blank first, enable last** — `init_vdp_g1`/`init_vdp_g2` force the bit off on the register pass so the VRAM bursts run blanked; the C tables (`SCREEN1_TABLE`, `SCREEN2_TABLE`) ship R1 = `$80` and `screen1_prepare()` / `screen2_init_bitmap()` do the first enable only once tables + SAT park are valid. Helpers: `vdp_display_off` / `vdp_display_on` ([`tms9918/tms9918_pad.asm`](tms9918/tms9918_pad.asm)). | **No enable bit** — the screen always shows *something*. The analogue is ordering: park the display on TEXT, scrub the framebuffer (plain RAM, writable in any mode), and flip to HIRES **last**. `gen2_hgr_init_clear` ([`gen2/gen2_init.asm`](gen2/gen2_init.asm)) is exactly that sequence (`GEN2_TEXTON` → clear `$2000-$3FFF` → `gen2_hgr_init`); plain `gen2_hgr_init` flips immediately and shows power-on SRAM garbage until the caller's own clear lands. |
| **Write pacing** | The data port drops writes spaced under ~16c during active Mode I/II display. **pad18 contract**: `JSR tms9918_pad18` between stores = 22c store-to-store (`tms9918_pad12` is a legacy alias resolving to pad18; the pad is flag-transparent by invariant). Free zones — display blanked or V-blank — serve ~2c ScreenOff slots, so init / full-screen bursts always fit ([`tms9918/tms9918_pad.asm`](tms9918/tms9918_pad.asm)). | Framebuffer = plain bus RAM: **no pacing**, `STA` at full speed. The care moves to the **soft switches**: READ-only toggles that return HST0 in bit 7 (bits 0-6 are floating-bus garbage). Poll only a switch already in your program's state (the poll IS a toggle) and OR two samples ≥ 4 cycles apart to mask the 3-cycle colour-burst notch ([`gen2/gen2.inc`](gen2/gen2.inc)). |
| **Frame wait** | `tms_wait_end_of_frame()` **drains** the stale F flag, polls, and **returns a status snapshot** (fresh F merged with C/5S accumulated across the wait). One status read per frame: a read latch-clears F+5S+C atomically — test the returned copy, never re-read ([`tms9918c/tms9918.c`](tms9918c/tms9918.c); propagated by `vsync_wait()`). | `gen2_wait_vbl()` **returns void** — HST0 is a level, not a latch: nothing to drain, no status to snapshot. Level-samples HST0 and returns ~3 lines into V-blank ([`gen2c/gen2_init.c`](gen2c/gen2_init.c)). Asm: `gen2_waitvbl` (coarse) / `gen2_beam_lock` (cycle-exact) in [`gen2/gen2_sync.asm`](gen2/gen2_sync.asm). |
| **Frame counter** | `vsync_frames` ([`tms9918c/vsync.c`](tms9918c/vsync.c)), bumped by `vsync_wait()`. | None — count your own around `gen2_wait_vbl()` calls. |
| **Exit to monitor** | `JSR vdp_display_off` then `JMP WOZMON`. ⚠ An R1 write also loads the VRAM address counter — never flip the display between a `vdp_set_write/read` and its data stream. Both tracks now use the `$FF1A` **prompt entry** (`WOZMON` in [`apple1/apple1.inc`](apple1/apple1.inc); the C runtime's `woz_mon()` in [`tms9918c/apple1_asm.s`](tms9918c/apple1_asm.s) was unified onto it June 2026 — `woz_mon_silent()` keeps the silent `$FF1F` warm restart for callers that printed their own status). | `JSR gen2_text_restore` (TEXT + PAGE1 toggles, [`gen2/gen2_init.asm`](gen2/gen2_init.asm)) then `JMP WOZMON` — hands the display back to the text page the monitor echoes on. The helper deliberately RTSes instead of jumping to Wozmon itself (pure GEN2 layer; the `WOZMON` equate belongs to the caller's `apple1.inc`). |

### The cc65 `-t none` DATA trap (both C tracks)

The `-t none` crt0 has **no copydata**: an initialized global — even `= 0` —
lands in the DATA segment and is **never copied** to its run address on a
load ≠ run (ROM) cfg; it silently holds power-on garbage. Only *uninitialized*
globals live in BSS, which crt0's zerobss clears on **every** entry (each
`4000R` / `6000R` re-run). RAM-load cfgs (load = run, e.g. `apple1_gen2_c.cfg`)
dodge the first-run bite because DATA ships inside the loaded image — but the
value is still stale on a warm re-entry without a re-load, and a move to a ROM
cfg breaks it. House pattern: **BSS + lazy default** or **zero-meaningful
encodings** —

- [`tms9918c/random.c`](tms9918c/random.c) — LFSR states deliberately
  uninitialized; `rand8()`/`rand16()` auto-seed when they read 0 (the old
  `= 0xAC` initializers were never applied, and a 0 state zero-locks an LFSR).
- [`tms9918c/screen2_pixel.c`](tms9918c/screen2_pixel.c) — `PLOT_MODE_SET` is
  defined as 0 precisely so the zerobss'd `screen2_plot_mode` **is** the
  default.
- [`gfx/gfx_text.c`](gfx/gfx_text.c) — cursor statics kept genuinely
  uninitialized; BSS zero = home position.
- [`gen2c/gen2_init.c`](gen2c/gen2_init.c) — `gen2_hgr_base` is BSS with a
  lazy default at the use sites (`if (!gen2_hgr_base) gen2_hgr_base = 0x20`):
  zero is not a valid page base, so BSS-zero means "not set yet".

## Cross-library zero-page map

ZP is the scarce shared resource and **collisions raise no error** — they
silently corrupt the other claimant (see the DANGER banner in
[`apple1/zp.inc`](apple1/zp.inc)). This table lists every slot a lib *reserves
by name* so you can spot overlaps before they bite. Slots come in two flavours:
**fixed-address** (the `zp.inc` baseline, `$00-$07` in declaration order) and
**floating** (a `.res 1` / `.importzp` whose address is wherever the linker lays
the `ZEROPAGE` segment — these don't collide by *address*, they collide by
*name*: two libs reserving the same symbol share one byte, which is intended for
the `zp.inc` baseline and accidental otherwise).

Both tables below are **machine-generated** by
[`../../tools/gen_zp_map.py`](../../tools/gen_zp_map.py) from the actual
sources (`.res` in `ZEROPAGE`/`.zeropage` blocks, `.importzp`/`.exportzp`,
fixed `:= $xx` equates). Do not edit them by hand — human notes live in
[`../../tools/zp_annotations.json`](../../tools/zp_annotations.json) and are
merged on regeneration; `gen_zp_map.py --check` diffs the tables against the
sources (CI-able drift guard).

**Baseline — `apple1/zp.inc`, fixed `$00-$07`** (opt-in; `.include` once before
any other ZP `.res`; `.exportzp`'d for cross-object use):

<!-- ZPMAP:BASELINE:BEGIN (generated by tools/gen_zp_map.py -- edit tools/zp_annotations.json, not this table) -->
| Addr | Symbol | Owner / users |
|---|---|---|
| `$00` | `tmp` | general scratch — `kbd.asm`, `math.asm`, `tms9918*.asm`, chess. Pure scratch: any lib JSR may clobber it |
| `$01` | `tmp2` | general scratch — `math.asm`, `tms9918m2.asm`, chess. Pure scratch: any lib JSR may clobber it |
| `$02` | `print_ptr_lo` | `apple1/print.asm` (string pointer, lo) |

| `$04` | `mul_tmp` | `m6502/multiply.asm` |

| `$07` | `prng_hi` | `m6502/prng8.asm` **and** `prng16.asm` (shared pair by design) |
<!-- ZPMAP:BASELINE:END -->

**Floating slots each lib reserves** (own `.res` in `ZEROPAGE`, or `.importzp`
the caller must declare). Each *track is used by one card at a time*, so the
real collision risk is mixing a peripheral driver with a graphics track that
both park names in the same low region — check before combining:

<!-- ZPMAP:FLOATING:END -->

`gen2`/`gen2c`/`tms9918c` keep their ZP convention in their own READMEs; the
`.res`-bearing TMS helpers (`sprite_triangle.asm`, `buffer_editor.asm`,
`tms9918_5strigger.asm`) declare project-private state documented at their use
sites. When ZP is tight, **alias** a slot onto existing scratch *before* the
include — the `.ifndef` guards detect it (recipe in `apple1/zp.inc`).

Three cross-cutting rules the tables can't show:

- **`tmp`/`tmp2` are pure scratch.** Any lib JSR may clobber them — never
  hold a value in them across a call into *any* lib routine.
- **`arg_lo`/`arg_hi` (+ `arg2_*`) are a shared argument/return window, not
  storage.** `m6502/math.asm`, `tms9918/sprite_triangle.asm` and
  `tms9918/buffer_editor.asm` all `.importzp` the same bytes; a value parked
  there is NOT live across a call between these modules — reload per call.
- **Wozmon reserves `$24-$2B`** (`XAML/XAMH/STL/STH/L/H/YSAV/MODE`): the
  monitor rewrites them on every prompt interaction, so a resident program
  must not park state there.
  [`../cc65/apple1_4k.cfg`](../cc65/apple1_4k.cfg) guards the reserve via its
  ZP ceiling (`$00-$22`); [`../cc65/apple1_gen2.cfg`](../cc65/apple1_gen2.cfg)
  does **not** (its ZP window is `$00-$3F`) — a gen2 program whose `ZEROPAGE`
  segment grows past `$23` overlaps the reserve and loses those bytes to any
  Wozmon round-trip.

### Symbol-collision registry (deliberate link-exclusive shadows)

Several Model-B objects export the SAME symbols on purpose — alternative
backends behind one seam. `ld65` errors on the duplicate if you link both
sides of a row; that error is the guard, not a bug. Pick per card / per need:

| Symbol(s) | Defined by | Pick |
|---|---|---|
| `init_vdp_g2`, `clear_bitmap`, `disable_sprites`, `vdp_set_write/read`, `calc_pix_addr`, `plot_set(_x16)`, `line_xy(16)`, `tms9918_pad18`, `vdp_display_off` + the `pix_*`/`ln_*`/`pen_color` ZP | [`tms9918/tms9918m2.asm`](tms9918/tms9918m2.asm) + [`tms9918/tms9918_pad.asm`](tms9918/tms9918_pad.asm) **vs** [`gen2/gen2_logom2.asm`](gen2/gen2_logom2.asm), which re-exports the whole seam (pads / VDP address ops become no-ops) | one backend per link — how LOGO's card-independent core targets either card |
| `disable_sprites`, `vdp_set_write`, `vdp_set_read` | [`tms9918/tms9918m1.asm`](tms9918/tms9918m1.asm) **vs** [`tms9918/tms9918m2.asm`](tms9918/tms9918m2.asm) | one TMS mode per program (m1 XOR m2) |
| `draw_bubble` | [`tms9918/bubble.asm`](tms9918/bubble.asm) **vs** [`gen2/gen2_bubble.asm`](gen2/gen2_bubble.asm) | per card |
| `text_blit_glyph` | [`tms9918/text_bitmap.asm`](tms9918/text_bitmap.asm) **vs** [`gen2/gen2_text_bitmap.asm`](gen2/gen2_text_bitmap.asm) (same `A`/`pix_x`/`pix_y`/`pen_color` contract) | per card |
| the whole `rt_*` seam (`rt_hgr`, `rt_hcolor`, `rt_plot`, `rt_line`, `rt_gr`, `rt_color`, `rt_loresplot`, `rt_hlin/vlin`, `rt_text`, `rt_home` + `rt_*` ZP) | [`basicrt/basicrt_tms.s`](basicrt/basicrt_tms.s) **vs** [`basicrt/basicrt_gen2.s`](basicrt/basicrt_gen2.s) | BASIC-compiler runtime backend: per target card |
| every sprite label (`creat_jelly_pat`, …) | `tms9918/sprites_*.asm` **vs** [`gen2/sprites/`](gen2/sprites/)`*_hgr.asm` — same names, **different data** (TMS native 32 B/sprite vs HGR 16×3 B rows) | per card; the format is implicit in which `.o` you pull |
| `prng_lo`/`prng_hi` (ZP state; Model A) | [`m6502/prng8.asm`](m6502/prng8.asm) **and** [`m6502/prng16.asm`](m6502/prng16.asm) | shared **by design** (`.ifndef`-guarded, no link error): including both compiles, but the two generators stir ONE state pair — use one |

## Validation

```
make -C dev/lib check
```

Validates the libraries themselves, **decoupled** from the projects that consume
them: asm↔C constant drift (`tools/check_lib_equates.py`), shared-font drift
(`tools/build_shared_font.py --check`), the `zp.inc` `$00-$07` layout pin, and a
compile of every C/asm source (so a primitive no project links yet still can't
rot). Companion to `make -C dev/codetank` — both must be green to ship. See
[`Makefile`](Makefile).
