// SnapshotIO — binary read/write primitives for the POM1 snapshot format.
//
// Format (versioned, little-endian throughout — POM1 is host-side LE only):
//
//   "POM1SNAP" (8 bytes)               magic
//   uint32_t  version                  format version (current = kSnapshotVersion below)
//   uint32_t  flags                    reserved, 0 for now
//
//   Section: "CPU\0\0\0\0\0" (8 bytes name) + uint32_t length + payload
//     payload: PC, A, X, Y, SP, status, IRQ, NMI, cycles  (M6502::serialize)
//
//   Section: "MEM\0\0\0\0\0" + uint32_t length + payload
//     payload: full 64 KB RAM, last keyboard byte + ready bit,
//              displayBusyCycles, ramSize, presetRamKB, oorStrictMode,
//              writeInRom. The card-enabled bitmap lives in its own "FLAGS"
//              section (not in MEM).
//
//   Section: "FLAGS\0\0\0" + uint32_t length + payload
//     payload: packed card-enabled bitmap. v1/v2 wrote a uint16_t (16 bits);
//              v3+ writes a uint32_t (adds the GEN2 HGR attach bit). The
//              reader picks the width from the section length, so old
//              snapshots still load (the extra bits read as 0).
//
//   Section per peripheral: name (8 bytes, NUL-padded) + uint32_t length +
//   peripheral->serialize() payload.  Unknown sections are skipped on load
//   (forward compat).  Cards that haven't migrated their state yet write
//   length==0 (no-op default in `Peripheral::serialize`).
//
// Everything is plain `fwrite`/`fread`. There is no compression and no
// checksum; the file is small (~70 KB) and the use case is "snapshot now,
// reload now" rather than archival cold storage. A SHA-256 footer would be a
// one-line append in a future version if a contributor wants archival use.

// v1: shipped April 2026 — base format (CPU/MEM/FLAGS + per-card sections).
// v2: May 2026 — adds IECCard section + kFlagIECCard (bit 15). v1 snapshots
//     load fine on v2 readers (unknown sections are skipped; missing
//     kFlagIECCard reads as 0 → IEC off).
// v3: June 2026 — widens the FLAGS payload from uint16_t to uint32_t and adds
//     the GEN2 HGR card-attach bit (bit 16). The reader switches on the FLAGS
//     section length, so v1/v2 snapshots (2-byte FLAGS) still load with the
//     GEN2 bit reading as 0 (HGR detached). Older readers see an unknown 4-byte
//     FLAGS payload — they read the low 2 bytes (legacy bits intact) and the
//     section-boundary realign skips the extra 2.
// v4: June 2026 — appends the MicroSD VIA T2 timer-running bool to the MicroSD
//     section, gated `r.version() >= 4` (MicroSD.cpp); pre-v4 snapshots read it
//     as false (timer idle on load), so they still round-trip.
// v5: July 2026 — appends the GEN2 published soft-switch video journal (last
//     completed frame's mid-line page/mode flips + that frame's start state) to
//     the GEN2VID section, gated `r.version() >= 5` (Memory.cpp). Pre-v5
//     snapshots read no journal (the section's length-prefix realigns), so a
//     restored beam-split frame simply falls back to the end-of-frame latch
//     until the next flip re-journals — the pre-fix behaviour.
// v6: August 2026 — two pieces of live device state that were never captured:
//     the PIA 6821's shadow registers (CRA/CRB + DDRA/DDRB, 4 bytes appended to
//     the MEM section) and the CFFA1's in-flight multi-sector counter (1 byte
//     appended to its own section). Both are read gated on `r.version() >= 6`;
//     pre-v6 snapshots restore the PIA to its post-reset seed ($A7/$A7/$00/$7F,
//     what resetMemory installs) and treat an in-flight CFFA1 transfer as its
//     last sector, which is exactly what those snapshots used to do.
// v7: September 2026 — a RUN section for the state a CYCLE-EXACT resume needs
//     and no section held: the CPU's DRAM-refresh switch and phase and an
//     interrupt entry's not-yet-charged cycles, the GEN2 floating-bus noise
//     generator, the terminal field phase, and the keys typed but not yet read
//     (Memory's key buffer). Input movies (issue #40) replay from a snapshot and
//     must land on the same cycles; without these a replay drifts by a refresh
//     stall or loses a queued key. Older readers skip the unknown section; a
//     pre-v7 snapshot restores none of it, which is what it always did.
