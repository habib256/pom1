// NativeFileDialog.h — thin portable wrapper around each desktop OS's
// localised file picker (Win32 GetOpenFileNameW, Cocoa NSOpenPanel/NSSavePanel,
// Linux: the xdg-desktop-portal FileChooser over D-Bus, else zenity, else
// kdialog). Returns false when no native backend is wired in (WASM, or a Linux
// box with none of the three) so the caller can fall back to the in-process
// ImGui browser. Strings are UTF-8 throughout — the Win32 impl translates
// to/from UTF-16 internally.
