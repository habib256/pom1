// SoftwareDirRules.h — which card a shipped software directory implies.
//
// Seventh seam of the family (Apple1KeyMap / FullscreenExpand / WindowGeometry /
// StagedCardConfiguration / LayoutDecisions / PresetDecisions / ShortcutTable):
// no ImGui, no GLFW, no MainWindow.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Loading a program from `software/Graphic HGR/` plugs the GEN2
// card and opens its framebuffer window; loading from `software/NET/` plugs the
// Wi-Fi modem — or resets it, if a BBS session is already up. That mapping was
// a seven-branch `else if` chain of `path.find("/X/") || path.find("\\X\\")`
// inside `performMemoryLoad`, and the file picker held the SAME mapping AGAIN,
// backwards, under a comment saying so out loud: "This is the reverse of the
// auto-enable-by-source-dir mapping in performMemoryLoad()". Two tables, one
// relation.
//
// Both directions are now one table. The rules that are easy to get wrong and
// invisible when you do are the ones this buys a test for:
//
//   - the match is on a path COMPONENT, both separators. Searching for a bare
//     substring would fire on `software/NETWORKING/`, and forgetting the
//     backslash form makes every rule silently dead on Windows.
//   - the chain was `else if`, so the FIRST rule wins on a path that carries
//     two markers. That was implicit in the source order; it is a documented
//     property here.
//   - not every rule is a picker default. microSD's content lives on the SD
//     filesystem rather than under `software/`, so it plugs the card on load but
//     must never be the folder the picker opens into — an omission from the
//     reverse table that was a comment, and is now a field.
